Resiliency: Exploring the Zoo of Data Classification (Binning) Schemes in Choropleth Maps

Cartographers often classify (or bin) quantitative attribute data into a few well-defined classes (or bins) before visualizing them in thematic maps; e.g., in choropleth maps, geographic areas are colored according to the bin in which the attribute value falls. Why? Map readers often find a few well-defined classes easier to understand than raw data as they help in simplifying and clarifying the main takeaway(s) from the map. This data classification (or binning), however, is challenging as there is no "ideal" scheme; many factors such as the distribution of data (e.g., is the data normally distributed?), purpose of making the map (e.g., does the map maker want to highlight outliers?), preferences of the map maker (e.g., do they have a "favorite" scheme?) often help determine this choice. Blindly applying a classification scheme may create false patterns on the map that bear little resemblance to the actual geographic phenomena that are intended to be portrayed, which is both ineffective and misleading. We present Resiliency to provide a tour through a zoo of sixteen data classification schemes for choropleth maps, e.g., Defined Interval, Equal Interval, Quantiles, Natural Breaks, Maximum Breaks, etc. Our hope is that Resiliency educates map makers to not "lie with maps", intentionally or accidentally.
